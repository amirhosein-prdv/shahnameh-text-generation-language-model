# Shahnameh Text Generation with LSTM

This project implements a language model for generating text inspired by the *Shahnameh*, an epic Persian poem written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. The model utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to learn patterns and structures from the Shahnameh text data and generate new passages that mimic the style of the original work.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training this model consists of passages from the *Shahnameh*. These passages are provided in the `dataset` folder. The text files contain both the original Persian text and its English translation, which can be useful for bilingual analysis and understanding.

## Usage

To train the LSTM model and generate text:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. 
3. Navigate to the notebook `Shahnameh_Text_Generation.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model.
5. Once trained, you can use the trained model to generate text using the provided functions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)

## Credits

This project is inspired by the work of Ferdowsi and the countless scholars and enthusiasts who have studied and preserved the *Shahnameh* over the centuries. The implementation of the LSTM model is based on modern deep learning techniques and libraries.
